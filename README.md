# Pothole-Detection-System

Pothole Detection using YOLO
This project aims to detect and identify potholes in images or videos using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. 
By leveraging deep learning techniques, the project provides a solution to automatically identify and localize potholes, which can be valuable for road maintenance and infrastructure management.

# Introduction

Potholes are a common problem on roads, causing inconvenience to drivers and potentially leading to accidents. Manual detection and monitoring of potholes can be time-consuming and expensive. This project offers an automated solution that uses the YOLO algorithm to detect and localize potholes in images or videos.
The YOLO algorithm is a real-time object detection system that analyzes an image in its entirety and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for different objects. By training a YOLO model on a dataset of pothole images, we can create a robust pothole detection system.

#F eatures

Detect potholes in images or videos
Provide bounding box coordinates for identified potholes
Allow customization and fine-tuning of the YOLO model for specific use cases
